# Web ThrustHP

This is a web based implementation of Barry Hobson's [ThrustHP Windows application](http://www.hoppenbrouwer-home.nl/ikarus/software/thrusthpv20d.htm).
This port was done with his blessing, back in 2008.

Since then some UI tweaks have been made, so it looks better on
mobile, but the intent is too keep this basic and be a useful tool
for people working on their aircraft.

Note, you are encouraged to check the equations are correct in the
source code, since errors can creep in. If you see errors, please
suggest corrections.

Currently only imperial units are supported.

Contributions are welcome.
